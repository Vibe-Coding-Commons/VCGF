# VCGF-ARCH-005 - Threat Modeling

**Control ID:** VCGF-ARCH-005  
**Status:** Normative  
**Requirement Level:** MUST

## Requirement

Projects and HIGH or CRITICAL changes MUST identify assets, trust boundaries, threat actors, abuse cases, security assumptions, and planned mitigations before implementation proceeds.

## Purpose

Establish a vendor-neutral governance requirement for threat modeling in AI-assisted software development.

## Risk Addressed

Unidentified or unmanaged risk that can lead to security defects, privacy violations, supply-chain compromise, operational blind spots, or unverifiable releases.

## Rationale

AI-assisted development can accelerate changes faster than traditional review cycles. This control ensures that the relevant risk is explicitly analyzed, implemented, and evidenced rather than assumed.

## Applicability

Apply according to the selected VCGF profile and whenever the capability or risk described by this control is present.

## Implementation-Neutral Guidance

Use a lightweight threat model for small changes and a structured model for major features or systems. At minimum document: protected assets; entry points; identities and trust boundaries; data flows; attacker capabilities; abuse cases; threats affecting confidentiality, integrity, availability, privacy, and authorization; mitigations; residual risk; and an owner. Revisit the model when authentication, authorization, sensitive data, infrastructure, integrations, or trust boundaries materially change.

## Verification Method

Inspect the relevant design, implementation, configuration, and evidence; run positive and negative tests where applicable; confirm that the control is enforced at a trusted layer.

## Required Evidence

A reproducible artifact such as a threat model, generated inventory, policy configuration, CI result, alert test, signed provenance record, review record, or release checksum, depending on the control.

## Exceptions

Use the VCGF exception-management process. Exceptions must identify risk, owner, compensating controls, approval, expiry, and review date.

## Dependencies

VCGF-GOV-001, VCGF-GOV-002, VCGF-GOV-004, and the applicable security or architecture controls.

## Related Controls

See the selected profile and domain index for related requirements.

- OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) 5.0 where applicable
- NIST Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) where applicable
- Project-specific regulatory or contractual overlays where applicable

## Platform Considerations

Platform adapters may identify native or configurable implementation surfaces. The normative requirement remains platform-independent.

## Change History

- 1.0.0: Added before the v1.0.0 control-ID freeze.
