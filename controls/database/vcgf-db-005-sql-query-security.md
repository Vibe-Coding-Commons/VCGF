# VCGF-DB-005 - SQL Query Security

**Control ID:** VCGF-DB-005  
**Status:** Normative  
**Requirement Level:** MUST

## Requirement

SQL queries MUST use parameterized interfaces for untrusted values and MUST NOT rely on string concatenation for data or authorization predicates.

## Purpose

Provide a stable, implementation-neutral VCGF requirement for sql query security.

## Risk Addressed

Security, privacy, integrity, availability, governance, or regression risk arising when this control is absent or bypassed.

## Rationale

AI-assisted development can accelerate unsafe assumptions and broad changes. This control creates a stable requirement that can be mapped consistently across tools and reviewed using evidence.

## Applicability

Apply when the project or change contains the relevant capability, data, trust boundary, or risk. Profile requirements may strengthen applicability.

## Implementation-Neutral Guidance

# SQL and Query Security

Use prepared statements/parameterized queries or safe ORM binding.

Never concatenate untrusted strings into SQL.

For dynamic identifiers such as sort column/direction, map user choices to hardcoded server-side values.

Raw SQL requires review and must never receive untrusted query fragments.

Stored procedures are not automatically safe; review internal dynamic SQL and privileges.

Runtime DB credentials should use least privilege and differ from migration/admin credentials when architecture permits.

## Verification Method

Inspect implementation and configuration, execute positive and negative tests appropriate to the control, and review evidence at the trusted enforcement layer.

## Required Evidence

At least one reproducible artifact such as a test result, code review, configuration record, security scan, migration review, or manual verification record.

## Exceptions

Use the VCGF exception process. Exceptions must be risk-owned, approved, time-bounded, and accompanied by compensating controls.

## Dependencies

VCGF-GOV-001, VCGF-GOV-004, and applicable architecture or identity controls.

## Related Controls

See the domain index and selected profile.

## References

- OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) 5.0
- OWASP Cheat Sheet Series where relevant
- OWASP API Security guidance where relevant

## Platform Considerations

Platform-specific implementation belongs in `platforms/<adapter>/mappings/`. This control does not assume a vendor capability.

## Change History

- 1.0.0: Initial VCGF control migrated and normalized from the previous framework.
