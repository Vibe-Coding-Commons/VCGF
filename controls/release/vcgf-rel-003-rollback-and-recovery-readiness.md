# VCGF-REL-003 - Rollback and Recovery Readiness

**Control ID:** VCGF-REL-003  
**Status:** Normative  
**Requirement Level:** MUST

## Requirement

High-risk releases MUST define how code, configuration, schema, and operational state can be recovered if validation fails after deployment.

## Purpose

Reduce AI-assisted engineering risk through a stable vendor-neutral requirement.

## Risk Addressed

Unauthorized change, security weakening, data exposure, architecture drift, integrity loss, or insufficient auditability.

## Rationale

VCGF separates normative policy from platform implementation so this requirement can be consistently enforced or evidenced across tools.

## Applicability

Apply according to project risk, selected profile, and affected trust boundaries.

## Implementation-Neutral Guidance

For irreversible data migrations, use backups, staged rollout, expand-contract patterns, or other documented recovery measures as applicable.

## Verification Method

Review the change, applicable configuration, test evidence, approval record, and platform mapping.

## Required Evidence

A reproducible review, test, configuration record, or approval artifact appropriate to the control.

## Exceptions

Exceptions follow `spec/exception-management.md`.

## Dependencies

VCGF-GOV-001 and VCGF-GOV-004 where applicable.

## Related Controls

See the selected profile and control catalog.

## References

- VCGF core risk and evidence model
- OWASP guidance where security-relevant

## Platform Considerations

Adapters may classify enforcement as native, configurable, prompt-enforced, external, partial, unsupported, not-applicable, or unverified.

## Change History

- 1.0.0: Initial control.
